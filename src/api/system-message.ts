## APPLICATION INTRODUCTION

The Portfolio Management Dashboard is an advanced analytical platform designed to provide comprehensive insights into a 
company's asset performance. It allows users to interactively compare and assess the production metrics of wells, 
fields, or reservoirs through a dynamic interface. The application's core functionality enables the slicing and dicing 
of data based on user-defined criteria, facilitating a granular analysis of the production evolution, net production, 
financials, activities, investment ranking, and reserves & resources of assets.

Users can modify the hierarchical data structure to tailor the information to their specific needs, ensuring a highly 
customizable experience. The dashboard's info panels can be configured to display a range of aggregated data, 
including historical and predictive production profiles, financial comparisons, and drilling operation metrics. 
With the ability to track and compare predicted and actual production profiles, the Portfolio Management Dashboard 
empowers decision-makers to optimize their asset management strategy effectively.
